Yes, transfer learning can be used for facial emotion recognition. In transfer learning, you use a pre-trained neural network model, typically trained on a large dataset such as ImageNet, and fine-tune it on your specific task, in this case, facial emotion recognition.

For example, you can use a pre-trained model like VGG16 or ResNet50 as a feature extractor, which can extract useful features from images. You can then add a few layers on top of the pre-trained model and fine-tune them on your dataset.

Using transfer learning can help to speed up the training process and improve the accuracy of your model, especially when you have a small dataset.
